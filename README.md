## 🔐 Cryptography Algorithms Module

### 🔹 SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- **SHA‑256** and **SHA‑512** hashing
- One‑way encryption used for password storage
- Fast, reliable, and widely used in security systems

### 🔹 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Symmetric encryption (same key for encrypt & decrypt)
- Uses **CBC Mode** with padding
- Commonly used in file and data encryption

### 🔹 RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- Asymmetric encryption (public & private keys)
- Secure key generation (2048‑bit)
- Used in secure communications and key exchange

📌 **Demo file included** to understand real execution flow.

## 🔑 Password Hashing & Cracking Module

### 🔸 Hashing Techniques

| Algorithm | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| MD5 | Basic hashing (educational use) |
| SHA‑256 | Secure password hashing |
| SHA‑512 | Stronger hashing |
| bcrypt | Industry‑grade password protection |
| Salted Hash | Prevents rainbow‑table attacks |

### 🔸 Password Cracking
- Brute‑force MD5 cracking
- Demonstrates **why weak passwords are dangerous**
- Limited length cracking for safe demonstration
